# Electrical-Task-3-Sensors
In this task, we are supposed to make an electrical circuit that consists of a digital sensor that calculate the distance of an object and show the distance on the serial monitor. I used an UltraSonic sensor, which is a digital sensor that uses soundwaves to find the distance of any object in front of it. Moreover, I added a LED that lights on if the object is closer than 100 cm. The circuit has been made using TinkerCAD.

## At distances less than 100 cm

in the following figure, the object is at a distance of 55 cm. Notice the LED is switched on.

## At distances more than 100 cm
in the following figure, the object is at a distance of 264 cm. The LED is switched off in this case.
