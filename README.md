# Electrical-Task-3-Sensors
In this task, we are supposed to make an electrical circuit that consists of a digital sensor that calculate the distance of an object and show the distance on the serial monitor. I used an UltraSonic sensor, which is a digital sensor that uses soundwaves to find the distance of any object in front of it. Moreover, I added two LEDs, a red one that lights on if the object is closer than 100 cm and a green one that lights up if the distance of the object is more than 100 cm. The circuit has been made using TinkerCAD.

## At distances less than 100 cm

in the following figure, the object is at a distance of 51 cm. Notice the red LED is switched on.

## At distances more than 100 cm
in the following figure, the object is at a distance of 143 cm. The green LED is switched on in this case.
